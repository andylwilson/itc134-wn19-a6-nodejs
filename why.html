        <h1>Why use Node.js?</h1>
        <p>Now that you've learned a bit about the history of Node.js and why it came into being, you're probably wondering what the real-world reasons are for wanting to get your feet wet in the language, and what advantages you will benefit from if you invest your time in it.</p>
        <p>So with that in mind, let's delve in to just why Node.js might be of use to you...</p>
        
        <h2>Using a language you're already familiar with</h2>
        <p>One of the most obvious bonuses of starting out in learning Node.js, is that if you've done any work on the web --and if you want to learn Node.js you most likely have-- you probably already have strong skills in, or at least a passing familiarity with JavaScript. With Node.js, as you could probably have denoted by the ".js" at the end, you'll already be starting with a foundational knowledge, as Node.js code is written in JavaScript.</p>
        
        <h2>A new career path for PHP and Ruby on Rails developers..</h2>
        <p>If you're already working in back-end web development, whether as a PHP, Ruby on Rails, or similar developer, you can parlay those engineering foundations into a larger job pool by learning Node.js to solve the same kind of development problems.</p>
        <p>What Node.js offers is allowing you to use JavaScript to build back-end functionality by bringing the V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome locally to your computer or server, allowing you to access files, process http requests, access databases, and all of the kinds of things typically reserved for back-end languages like the aforementioned.</p>
        
        <h2>MEAN is nicer than LAMP</h2>
        <p>Following on that idea of using JavaScript to code both the front-end and back-end thanks to Node.js, as well as opening up a new career path for PHP, Ruby, and Python developers; another great benefit of learning Node.js is that you will be well on your way to being able to take advantage of what is typically referred to as the MEAN stack.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast to the popular LAMP stack, which utilizes Linux, Apache, MySQL, and one of those "P" languages to create web applications, the MEAN stack is designed as a "JavaScript everywhere" stack, utilizing MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js (or one of the other popular MVC frameworks like React.js, Ember.js,  or Vue.js), and Node.js to create modern web applications. Using this stack, you will be able to utilize your JavaScript skills throughout the stack, as well as JSON for data which largely resemble JavaScript objects.</p>
        
        <h2>Designed for asynchronous speed..</h2>
        <p>If you're thinking about developing applications that rely on fast I/O, such as messaging apps or browser games, learning Node.js will greatly help you with those goals as well, as it was architected specifically to be great at scaling and fast I/O. </p>
